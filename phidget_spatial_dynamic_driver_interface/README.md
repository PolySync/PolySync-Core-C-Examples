### phidget_spatial_dynamic_driver_interface

This is an example of the dynamic driver interface. The official interface for any hardware device or sensor data to get into a PolySync system.

The interface is written for the Phidget Spatial, an inexpensive accelerometer sensor thatâ€™s easy to access. This provides the user freedom to adjust the sensor and learn more about the dynamic driver interface code.

It defines a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and a the PolySync Abstraction Layer (PAL) to make a complete dynamic driver interface for a sensor or hardware device.

For more information, see [Creating A Dynamic Driver Interface Workflow](https://help.polysync.io/articles/development/dynamic-driver-hw-interface-development/creating-a-dynamic-driver-interface/).

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev

To install on Ubuntu: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```
Install the Phidget libraries by following these instructions: http://www.phidgets.com/docs/OS_-_Linux#Installing

### Building and running the node
* To build the full project, first build the HAL (drivers) then the PAL (interfaces)

1. Build the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

```bash
$ cd drivers/phidet_spatial
$ make
```

2. Build the PolySync Abstraction Layer (PAL)

```bash
$ cd interfaces/phidget_spatial
$ make
$ make install   # installs to PSYNC_HOME/lib/ 
```

### rnr_node

This is an example of both the Record and Replay API, and the coupled Logfile API.

It is an example of a node that listens and responds to the `ps_rnr_msg` messages, which command the node to use Logfile API resources that facilitate synchronized record and replay across all nodes on the system.

You would use this example if you needed a node to log incoming messages (that itâ€™s subscribed to), to be able to replay later. 

PolySync provides the dynamic drivers that record sensor data, but you may also want to record the algorithm inputs and/or outputs.

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev

To install on Ubuntu: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
```

### Building and running the node

```bash
$ cd rnr_node
$ make
$ ./bin/polysync-rnr-node-c 
```

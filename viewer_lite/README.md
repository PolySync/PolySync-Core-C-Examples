### viewer_lite

This is more of a tool than an API example. It will visualize LiDAR, RADAR, and object data from multiple sources on the PolySync bus.

This example has tools to freeze-frame, measure distance, color by source or type, and is great for building sensor fusion applications.

The graphics were built with OpenGL and are very extendable. It has a built in system/node management tool to dynamically handle nodes coming on/off bus.

### Hardware requirements

Sensors: LiDAR, RADAR

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev freeglut3-dev

To install on Ubuntu: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev freeglut3-dev
```

### Building and running the node

```bash
$ cd viewer_lite
$ make
$ ./bin/polysync-viewer-lite 
```

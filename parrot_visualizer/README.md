### parrot_visualizer

This is a simple example that “simulates” how a vehicle would respond to actuation commands in PolySync.

It receives both `ps_platform_steering_command_msg` and `ps_platform_throttle_command_msg`, and actuates the parrot as specified.

It publishes back platform motion messages to indicate the parrot's position. It depends on the `parrot_controller` example running.

For more detailed information, look at the [Vehicle Control Tutorial](https://help.polysync.io/articles/tutorials-and-examples/tutorials/vehicle-control-tutorial/).

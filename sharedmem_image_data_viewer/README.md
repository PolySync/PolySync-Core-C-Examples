### sharedmem_image_data_viewer

This example is the same as the `image_data_viewer` example, but it uses the shared memory queue rather than the Ethernet bus to transmit the incoming image sensor data.

You must set up the shared memory queue buffer size prior to starting the application.

Note that it expects RGB24 pixel format.

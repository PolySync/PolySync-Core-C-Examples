### logfile_iterator_for_velodyne

This example is based on the logfile_iterator example. It differs in that it provides a concrete example of iterating over Velodyne LiDAR logfile data stored as a `ps_byte_array_msg` in a `plog` file.

Within the logfile iterator callback, this example shows how to use the dynamic driver Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) header file for the Velodyne HDL to cast raw, non-abstracted `plog` data to the low-level OEM defined C structs.

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev

To install on Ubuntu:

### Building and running the node

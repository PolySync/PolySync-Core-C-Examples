### logfile_to_pcap_convertor

This example is a tool that converts a `ps_byte_array_msg` from a **Velodyne sensor** and converts the buffer to a pcap formatted file. 

It uses the logfile iterator method to traverse an existing `plog` file.

The PCAP file can be opened with the Velodyne VeloView application.

The tool can be tweaked to convert other data to PCAP format, and to work with other sensors.

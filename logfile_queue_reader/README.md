### logfile_queue_reader

This is an example of a node that uses the Logfile API routines to replay a PolySync logfile using the message queue instead of subscribing to a high-level PolySync message type.

This node accesses the raw, non-abstracted `plog` data, and leverages the dynamic driver Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) header file to cast the raw data to low-level OEM defined C structs.

This example also acts as a guide for when you want to access the raw sensor data, just as it was sent on the wire, before the dynamic driver processes and abstracts the data.

   {{% note %}} This does not effect the functionality of the dynamic driver, it will still process and publish the high-level message types, as defined in the SDF Configurator node entry. {{% /note %}}

You would use this node if you wanted to filter or pre-process the sensor data before itâ€™s published to the PolySync bus.

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev

To install on Ubuntu: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
```

### Building and running the node

```bash
$ cd logfile_queue_reader
$ make
$ ./bin/polysync-logfile-queue-reader-c 
```

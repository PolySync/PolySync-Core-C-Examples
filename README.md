# PolySync examples in C

Here you can find examples that demonstrate how to use PolySync's APIs.

## Core APIs

- [Publish/Subscribe](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/publish_subscribe) - Publish and subscribe to a PolySync communications bus.
- [Node Template](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/node_template) - Understand the standardized PolySync node state machine.
- [Coordiniate Transform (single)](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/single_transform) - Use the Transform API to transform coordinate frames.
- [Coordiniate Transform (stack)](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/transform_stack) - Use the Transform API to transform coordinate frames using a stack.
- [Logfile Writer](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/logfile_writer) - Use the Logfile API routines to log a PolySync byte array message.

## Data Model
 - [User Data Model](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/user_data_model) - Shows how to use publish/subscribe routines with a user data model message type.

## Message APIs
- [Parameter Get/Set](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/get_set) - Query and set runtime state of a remote application.
- [Shared Memory Image Data Viewer](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/blob/master/sharedmem_image_data_viewer/src/sharedmem_image_data_viewer.c) - View image data received over the PolySync shared memory queue.
 
## Device APIs

- [Socket Reader](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/socket_reader) - Read data from a network device. 
- [Socket Writer](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/socket_writer) - Write data to a network device.
- [Serial Writer](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/serial_writer) - Write data to a serial device.
- [Serial Reader](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/serial_reader) - Read data from a serial device.
- [Can Reader](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/can_reader) - Read data from a CAN device.
- [Can Writer](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/can_writer) - Write data to a CAN device.
- [Video Device with Encode/Decode](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/video_encode_decode) - Communicate with a video device, encode, and decode video data.

## Utilities and cool stuff

- [Record and Replay Control](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/rnr_control) 
- [Viewer Lite](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/viewer_lite) - A lightweight 2D data viewer using OpenGL.
- [Image Data Viewer](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/image_data_viewer) - Decode and view compressed image data over the PolySync bus.
- [Joystick Commander](https://github.com/PolySync/PolySync-Core-C-Examples/tree/master/joystick_commander) - Use a USB joystick to send low-level control commands.
